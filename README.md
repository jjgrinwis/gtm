# Akamai GTM
### Akamai GTM Terraform example with CIDR map

An example that will create a GTM akadns.net domain with two DC's and a CIDR map.
The propery resource of the GTM domain will attach the two together.

Used https://github.com/akamai/cli-terraform to create some .tf files as an example from an existing setup.
